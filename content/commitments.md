This document contains set of commitment hashes. I use these to
document knowledge of active research topics, private projects,
ideas to prove that I had knowledge of these ideas at a specific
time.

The commitments in this document are made using `openssl blake2s256`
and `sha256sum`. Snapshots using the internet archive are made to
provide authentic time stamps:
